We think that the incremental model was most appropriate for this project We think this because the project had stable requirements and they were completely understood at the beginning of the project We also completed our project in \hyperlink{process-model_8txt_aa72783f12faaa2e4a8dd5489f27105e3}{increments} according to the \hyperlink{process-model_8txt_a513e8e85a7bcfad5ea4f0f97e40c05cb}{model}
