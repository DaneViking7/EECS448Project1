We think that the incremental model was most appropriate for this project.
We think this because the project had stable requirements and they were completely
understood at the beginning of the project. We also completed our project in
increments according to the model; we accomplished the core of the project first
by communicating and planning, then coding and constructing, and then repeated the
process to implement the remaining features and functions that were needed once
the first increment was completed. With each of these increments, we worked to
continuously integrate the previous increments with the new ones to finish the
project requirements.
